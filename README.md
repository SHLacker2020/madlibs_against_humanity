# Madlibs Against Humanity

Welcome to Madlibs Against Humanity, a place where users can create and review madlibs, and search based on category.

# SplashPage

This will host a signup and login button for the users to register and login. Ideally we will have a wheel of the top 15 madlips displayed for the user to see but not participate in until logged in. 

# Creating a Madlib

Logged in users will be able to create a madlib adding blanks whenever they would like and marking each 'blank' with a word (type)

# Rating a Madlib

Once a user is logged in they have the choice to create or do madlibs, once they complete a madlib, they can review it with a 1-5 star rating, this will place said Madlib higher or lower on the list of madlibs from that category

# Madlib Generator

Users who have created a madlib may want to see it in action right away, we will be adding a word pool API to our app so users can have the ability to run their newly created Madlibs through a work generator and see how it looks after some random words have filled in the blanks.
