This will host a signup and login button for the users to register and login. Ideally we will have a wheel of the top 15 madlips displayed for the user to see but not participate in until logged in. 

# Creating a Madlib

Logged in users will be able to create a madlib adding blanks whenever they would like and marking each 'blank' with a word (type)

# Rating a Madlib

Once a user is logged in they have the choice to create or do madlibs, once they complete a madlib, they can review it with a 1-5 star rating, this will place said Madlib higher or lower on the list of madlibs from that category

# Your Madlibs

A user will also have the ability to view there own created madlibs with the current ratings as well as edit, or update them.
